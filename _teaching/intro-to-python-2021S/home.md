## Course Information
- Schedule: July 12 - July 16, 2021; 9:00 am - 5:00 pm (Pacific Time).
- Wenxuan's [email](mailto: wzhao78@wisc.edu). 
- Format: Live Online via **Zoom**.
    - recorded lectures will be available for a time after class ends.

## Course Material
1. Course website (this site)
2. Google Colab
3. Piazza
4. Zoom for taking the class synchronously 

## Piazza

- Piazza is a site that promotes interatctions among peers and communications between peers and instructors for a class. Students can ask questions (anonymously or with name) and peers and instructors can contribute by answering or providing hints to the questions. 
- You do not need to create an account. I will manually enroll you to the piazza site using your provided email address. Then piazza will send you an email with a link to register for the class. 

## Google Colab

- When I was a TA last semester at UW-Madison teaching similair material, we spent the whole first week resolving installation and configuration issues related to Jupiter notebook, Python, and Anaconda (if you do not know those things, they are required for the class). Thus, due to the time constraint of this workshop, I decided to use Google Colab as it requires *zero* installation and configuration. The only thing that is needed from you is a browser and a **Google account**. 
- What is Google Colab? Check [here](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html).
  - Free
  - Able to use some (limited but sufficient for the purpose of this workshop) google machine learning recourses (computing power, memory) 
  - open code files from Google Drive and GitHub
- How to register for Google Colab? Go to [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index), and click the blue sign in button at the upper right corner and sign in to google colab using your Google account. 

## Course Description
- This course is an introduction to computer programming with Python for data science, including basic programming concepts, Python data types and data structures, branching, loops, functions, debugging, documentation, input/output with files, and data science techniques including statistical inference, classification and clustering, prediction, and visualization. **Note: previous programming experience is not assumed!**

## Learning Goals
- How to read, write, run, and debug Python code.
- How to process raw data in a reproducible pipeline.
- Write python programs to specific data science needs.
- How to interpret and present results.
