## Methods of Learning & Teaching
- Lectures and code demos will be presented on Zoom; students are expected to
listen/watch during specified times. Students are encouraged to follow along code demos on
their personal computer, but this is not required. Out-of-class reading material and coding
practice will be provided and encouraged (programming is a skill, it requires practice!). There are no graded assignments.
