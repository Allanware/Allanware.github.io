# Bio 
I am currently a Computer Science graduate student at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). Previously I spent 4 years at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) as an undergrad, majoring in CS and minoring in Statistics. I love playing/watching soccer(my club [FC Barcelona](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/) that gives me pleasure as well as an equal amount of pain), playing Go/Baduk (I am a 4 dan amateur player certified by both China and Japan), watching movies, and any subjects that have structures I can appreciate.
