# Bio 
I am currently a Computer Science graduate student at [**UW-Madison**](https://www.wisc.edu/). Previously I was an undergrad at [**UC Davis**](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), majoring in CS and minoring in Statistics. I love playing/watching soccer(my club [**FC Barcelona**](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/) that gives me pleasure as well as an equal amount of pain), playing Go/Baduk (4 dan amateur player certified by both China and Japan), watching movies, and any subjects that have structures I can appreciate. 

# Updates 
- I am going to teach a 5-day workshop on *Introduction to Python for Data Science*, offered by
the [UCSB Extension](https://professional.ucsb.edu/).
- Learning the 10-hole harmonica.
- Learning the freestyle swimming.
