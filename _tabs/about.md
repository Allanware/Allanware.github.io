I am currently a Computer Science graduate student at [**UW-Madison**](https://cs.wisc.edu). Previously I was an undergrad at [**UC Davis**](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), majoring in CS and minoring in Statistics. I love playing/watching soccer(my club [**FC Barcelona**](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/) that gives me pleasure as well as an equal amount of pain), playing Go/Baduk (4 dan amateur player certified by both China and Japan), watching movies, and any subjects that have structures I can appreciate. 

# Updates
